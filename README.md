#### Basic Data Structures

- To understand the abstract data types stack, queue, deque, and list.
- To be able to implement the ADTs stack, queue, and deque using Python lists.
- To understand the performance of the implementations of basic linear data structures.
- To understand prefix, infix, and postfix expression formats.
- To use stacks to evaluate postfix expressions.
- To use stacks to convert expressions from infix to postfix.
- To use queues for basic timing simulations.
- To be able to recognize problem properties where stacks, queues, and deques are appropriate data structures.
- To be able to implement the abstract data type list as a linked list using the node and reference pattern.
- To be able to compare the performance of our linked list implementation with Pythonâ€™s list implementation.


#### Recursion

- To understand that complex problems that may otherwise be difficult to solve may have a simple recursive solution.
- To learn how to formulate programs recursively.
- To understand and apply the three laws of recursion.
- To understand recursion as a form of iteration.
- To implement the recursive formulation of a problem.
- To understand how recursion is implemented by a computer system.
